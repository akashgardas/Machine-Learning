# Data Structures

    1. Sequences
    2. Sets
    3. Dictionaries

---------------------------------------------------------

# Lists

    - Ordered
    - Mutable
    - Duplicates are allowed
    - Mixed data types

### Methods

    - append, pop, remove
    - sort
    - List slicing

### List comprehensions & Nested List Comprehensions

---------------------------------------------------------

## Practice Programs

1. Demonstrate list methods
2. Display neg values from a numbers list
3. Second largest from a list
4. Count even and odds in a list
5. Delete an element from a list without using built-in methods
6. Count frequency of each element in a list
7. Filter unique elements from a list
8. Count the number of duplicate values in a list
9. You are building a simple E-commerce application in python. The system should maintain a list of products available in the cart. Write a python program to perform the following operations using lists:
   - Add a product to the cart
   - Remove a product from the cart
   - Search for a product in the cart
   - Display all products in the cart
   - Count number of products in the cart

# Tuples

    - immutable

---------------------------------------------------------

## Practice Programs
1) A school stores student records as tuples in the format (roll_no, name, marks)
    Write a python program to:
    - Store the data of 5 students in a list of tuples
    - Print the name of the student who scored the highest marks
    - Print all students who scored more than 75 marks

2) Count alphabet, digits and special characters in a string
3) Count vowels and consonants in a string
4) Count number of words in a string
5) Count freq of a character in a string
6) Write a program for the following
    input: aaabbca
    output: a4b2c1
