# Smart Parking System:
    ‚Ä¢ Create classes Vehicle, ParkingSpot, and ParkingLot.
    ‚Ä¢ Create multiple objects (vehicles, spots, parking lot).
        ‚Ä¢ Demonstrate object creation, attribute initialization, and method calls.
    ‚Ä¢ Make sensitive attributes private (e.g., license plate, owner name, spot status).
    ‚Ä¢ Provide getter/setter methods to access/update them safely.
        ‚Ä¢ Show that direct access fails but methods work.
## Vehicle is the base class.
    ‚Ä¢ Derived classes:
        Bike (extra attribute: helmet_required)
        Car (extra attribute: seats)
        SUV (extra attribute: four_wheel_drive)
        Truck (extra attribute: max_load_capacity)
    ‚Ä¢ Each child class overrides display() to print its own details.
    ‚Ä¢ Create a list of different vehicle objects (Bike, Car, SUV, Truck).
    ‚Ä¢ Iterate and call display() ‚Üí each object responds differently.

‚Ä¢ Implement a calculate_parking_fee() method:
    Bike ‚Üí ‚Çπ20/hour
    Car ‚Üí ‚Çπ50/hour
    SUV ‚Üí ‚Çπ70/hour
    Truck ‚Üí ‚Çπ100/hour

    ‚Ä¢ Demonstrate runtime polymorphism by calling the method on different objects.

‚Ä¢ Create an abstract class/interface Payment (using abc module).
    ‚Ä¢ Define an abstract method process_payment(amount).

‚Ä¢ Create child classes:
    CashPayment
    CardPayment
    UPIPayment

‚Ä¢ Demonstrate abstraction by processing payments differently (just print ‚ÄúPaid ‚ÇπX via UPI‚Äù).

### Task 1: Vehicle Classes
    Implement base and derived vehicle classes with encapsulation.
    Override display() and calculate_parking_fee().

### Task 2: ParkingSpot Class
    Implement ParkingSpot with size restrictions (S, M, L, XL).
    Methods: assign_vehicle(), remove_vehicle().
    Ensure vehicle type fits correct spot size (Bike ‚Üí S+, Car ‚Üí M+, SUV ‚Üí L+, Truck ‚Üí XL only).

### Task 3: ParkingLot Class
    Store multiple parking spots.
    Methods:
    add_spot() ‚Üí add new parking spots.
    show_spots() ‚Üí display all spots and their status.
    park_vehicle(vehicle) ‚Üí find suitable spot and park.
    unpark_vehicle(vehicle) ‚Üí remove from spot and calculate fee.

### Task 4: Payment (Abstraction + Polymorphism)
    When un-parking a vehicle, calculate fee (based on hours).
    Ask user for payment method ‚Üí process payment using appropriate child class.

### Task 5: Main Program
    Create a parking lot with mixed spots.
    Create multiple vehicle objects.
    Park/unpark vehicles.
    Demonstrate encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction throughout.


# Output:

Create Parking Lot and Spots
# Input (program initialization):
lot = ParkingLot("CityMall Parking")
## Add spots of different sizeslot.add_spot(ParkingSpot(1, "S"))
lot.add_spot(ParkingSpot(2, "M"))
lot.add_spot(ParkingSpot(3, "M"))
lot.add_spot(ParkingSpot(4, "L"))
lot.add_spot(ParkingSpot(5, "XL"))

# Output:
Parking Lot Created: CityMall Parking Total Spots Added: 5 
üü¢ Step 2: Create Vehicles
# Input:
bike1 = Bike("B101", "TS01AB1234", "Rahul", True)
car1 = Car("C201", "TS05CD5678", "Priya", 5)
suv1 = SUV("S301", "TS09EF9012", "Anjali", True)
truck1 = Truck("T401", "TS11XY4455", "Ravi", 12)

# Output:
Vehicles Created: Bike ‚Üí ID: B101, Plate: TS01AB1234, Owner: Rahul Car  ‚Üí ID: C201, Plate: TS05CD5678, Owner: Priya SUV  ‚Üí ID: S301, Plate: TS09EF9012, Owner: Anjali Truck‚Üí ID: T401, Plate: TS11XY4455, Owner: Ravi 
üü¢ Step 3: Park Vehicles
# Input:
lot.park_vehicle(bike1)   # Should go to Spot 1 (S)lot.park_vehicle(car1)    # Should go to Spot 2 (M)lot.park_vehicle(suv1)    # Should go to Spot 4 (L)lot.park_vehicle(truck1)  # Should go to Spot 5 (XL)lot.show_spots()

# Output:
Parking Status:
Spot 1 (S): Occupied ‚Üí Bike (TS01AB1234)
Spot 2 (M): Occupied ‚Üí Car (TS05CD5678)
Spot 3 (M): EmptySpot 4 (L): Occupied ‚Üí SUV (TS09EF9012)
Spot 5 (XL): Occupied ‚Üí Truck (TS11XY4455)
üü¢ Step 4: Unpark a Vehicle + Payment
# Input:
lot.unpark_vehicle(car1, hours=3)   # Car stayed 3 hours 

# Output:
Car (TS05CD5678) removed from Spot 2Parking Fee = ‚Çπ150 Select Payment Method: 1. Cash 2. Card 3. UPI
Enter choice: 3Paid ‚Çπ150 using UPI
üü¢ Step 5: Final Status
# Input:
lot.show_spots()

# Output:
Parking Status:
Spot 1 (S): Occupied ‚Üí Bike (TS01AB1234)
Spot 2 (M): EmptySpot 3 (M): EmptySpot 4 (L): Occupied ‚Üí SUV (TS09EF9012)
Spot 5 (XL): Occupied ‚Üí Truck (TS11XY4455)
